            &nbsp;&nbsp;IIT Goa, only six years into its inception, has already grown to be a highly sought-after institution for engineering aspirants throughout the country, nestled into the vast and beautiful campus of GEC in Farmagudi with a vibrant population of over three thousand students and five hundred faculty members. With Cepheus, we strive to achieve excellence in technical endeavours; however, we are not untouched by the rich and unique culture of Goa, which will be reflected in the fest’s various subtleties.
